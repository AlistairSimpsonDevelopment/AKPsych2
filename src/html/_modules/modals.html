              <strong>Abuse, Trauma & PTSD</strong>
              </h3>

              <p class="copy px-3">
                For survivors of emotional, physical and/or sexual abuse and those who have experienced other traumatic events in
                their lives, pain, anger and shame may be difficult emotions to escape, and can make day-to-day living extremely difficult.
              <br><br>
                Alexandra uses a client-led approach when working with individuals who have experienced trauma. She works gently and
                compassionately to co-create a safe space for clients to begin to process what has happened to them and its effect on their lives.

            <strong>Depression & Anxiety</strong>
            </h3>
            <p class="copy px-3">
              Feeling low, lonely and hopeless are all signs that it may be helpful to talk to someone about what you
              are going through, but this first step can seem very daunting. Likewise, many of us suffer from anxiety
              in our day to day lives which may make life a constant battle. We may have safety behaviours that we have
               to complete in order to keep our anxiety at bay and avoid panic taking over, or have a sense of dread and
               not understand why.
              <br><br>
              Alexandra will help you to talk through how you are feeling and think with you about these feelings  in relation to the
              rest of your life. She will work with you to tailor the type of therapy you wish to receive. This may mean spending time
              exploring the possible origins or root of feelings of depression and anxiety, or it may mean creating a formulation of
              the problem together and making a plan for how to, for example, reduce safety behaviours or become more active.

          <strong>Family, Relationships <br>& Interpersonal Problems</strong>
        </h4>
        <p class="copy px-3">
          Many of us may have grown up with challenging family dynamics, and this in turn might have had
          long lasting repercussions on our lives even today. Others of us might feel that we have always
          had strong bonds with family and loved ones, yet negotiating the demands and pressures of relationships
          can often be difficult.
          <br><br>
          Very often in our relationships, the love and care we receive is conditional on our acting or being a particular
          version of ourselves for others. Alexandra will provide an environment of non-judgement and acceptance where you
          will have the freedom to explore the impact of the relationships you are concerned about. Having a space that is
          just for you is an empowering step towards breaking unwanted patterns in our relationships and thinking about them
          from new perspectives.
